# Privacy Policy (Project-level)

Encorely processes audio locally on device. The project, as provided, does not include any tracking SDKs or analytics by default.

- Microphone access: If recording features are enabled, the app will request microphone permission. Audio is processed locally; recordings remain on device unless you export them.
- Music library: If future features integrate with the media library, access will be requested at use time.
- Analytics/telemetry: None by default. Any future analytics should be opt-in with clear toggles.
- Data sharing: None by default.

For app distribution, ensure your App Store Connect privacy questionnaire matches the actual behaviors. Update this document alongside any feature that changes data handling.

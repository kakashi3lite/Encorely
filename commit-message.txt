chore(assets): add asset verification script

This commit implements a comprehensive asset management pipeline to ensure
reliability and prevent missing assets. The implementation includes:

- AssetScanner for cataloging all assets in Assets.xcassets
- AssetManifestGenerator for creating ASSET_MANIFEST.json
- AssetValidator for validation against the manifest
- Asset helper for type-safe access to app assets
- GitHub Action workflow for CI/CD integration
- Pre-commit hook for local validation
- SwiftLint rules for asset usage compliance

Resolves #23

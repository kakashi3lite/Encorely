### üó£Ô∏è Voice Commands
Examples of supported voice interactions:
```
"Hey Siri, analyze this song"
"Hey Siri, create a relaxing mixtape"
"Hey Siri, show my music insights"
"Hey Siri, play relaxing music"
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Error Handling Architecture

### Error Types
- **AIError**: Core app errors (URL, network, audio/image loading)
- **AudioProcessingError**: Audio analysis and processing errors
- **AIGenerationError**: AI-related failures in content generation
- **CoreDataError**: Data persistence and model errors

### Error Propagation
- **Publishers**: Services expose error publishers for reactive handling
- **Async/Await**: Audio processing uses modern error propagation
- **Completion Handlers**: Legacy components use Result types
- **LocalizedError**: All errors provide user-friendly messages

### User Feedback
- Inline error states with retry options
- Toast notifications for transient errors
- Error banners for critical failures
- Graceful fallbacks for AI features

### Recovery Strategies
- Automatic retry for transient failures
- Data persistence for offline recovery
- Graceful degradation of AI features
- User-initiated retry actions

## üîí Privacy & Security

- **On-Device Processing**: All AI analysis happens locally
- **Data Encryption**: Secure storage of user preferences
- **Privacy First**: No external data sharing
- **Transparent AI**: Clear explanations of AI decisions

## üéØ Testing Strategy

### Core Tests
- Unit tests for AI services
- Integration tests for data flow
- UI tests for critical paths

### AI Model Testing
- **Objective**: Validate mood detection accuracy
- **Method**: Controlled audio samples
- **Duration**: 4-6 weeks
- **Success Criteria**: Positive mood detection accuracy >80%

## üìù Workflow Logs

This project uses workflow logs to track automated build, test, and deployment processes. These logs are essential for:
- **Debugging**: Quickly identifying issues in CI/CD pipelines
- **Traceability**: Auditing changes and their impact on the codebase
- **Collaboration**: Sharing build/test results with contributors

### Where to Find Workflow Logs
- **GitHub Actions**: If using GitHub, logs are available under the 'Actions' tab of your repository.
- **Local Logs**: Build and test logs are generated in the `BUILD_REPORT.md` file and other relevant log files in the project root.

### How to Use Workflow Logs
- Review logs after each commit or pull request to ensure all checks pass.
- Use logs to trace errors, failed tests, or deployment issues.
- Reference logs in issues or pull requests for better context.

For more details, see the [BUILD_REPORT.md](./BUILD_REPORT.md) file and your repository's CI/CD provider documentation.

# Encorely

Encorely is a Swift Packageâ€“first codebase with two core modules:

- GlassUI: SwiftUI components with modern glassmorphism and accessibility fallbacks.
- AudioKitEncorely: Audio utility module with session management stubs and DSP helpers.

This foundation compiles and tests on macOS runners in CI, and is ready to be embedded into an iOS app target.

## Requirements
- macOS 13+ with Xcode 15+ (Swift 5.9)

## Build
```bash
swift build
```

## Test
```bash
swift test
```

## Modules
- GlassUI: Start with `GlassCard` for frosted UI blocks (Reduce Transparency supported).
- AudioKitEncorely: Includes `DSP.rms(_:)` and a cross-platform-safe `AudioSessionManager` API.

## Next Steps (suggested)
- Create an iOS app target that consumes these modules (Xcode project or XcodeGen).
- Implement full AVAudioSession routing and interruptions inside `AudioSessionManager` (iOS only).
- Grow the Glass UI Kit (Toolbar, ListRow, TactileButton) and add snapshot/UI tests.
- Add CI linting (swift-format/SwiftLint) and code coverage reporting.

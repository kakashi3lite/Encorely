# Enhanced Audio Analysis Module

This module enhances the audio analysis capabilities of the Encorely application with comprehensive spectral and mood detection features.

## Overview

The enhanced Audio Analysis module provides detailed audio feature extraction with advanced spectral analysis, efficient memory management, and improved performance monitoring.

## Key Components

### 1. AudioAnalysisService

The core service that handles audio file analysis with the following features:

- **Comprehensive Spectral Analysis**: Extracts detailed spectral features from audio
- **Buffer Pooling**: Efficiently reuses audio buffers to reduce memory pressure
- **Performance Monitoring**: Tracks analysis time, memory usage, and CPU load
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with recovery mechanisms

### 2. FFTProcessor

An enhanced FFT processor that extracts detailed spectral features:

- **Advanced Spectral Metrics**: Centroid, spread, roll-off, flux
- **Band Energy Analysis**: Bass, mid-range, and treble energy levels
- **Perceptual Features**: Brightness, roughness, and harmonic content

### 3. AudioFeatures Model

A comprehensive model for representing audio characteristics:

- **Core Features**: Energy, valence, tempo, danceability
- **Spectral Features**: Detailed frequency-domain characteristics
- **Perceptual Attributes**: Acousticness, liveness, speechiness
- **Mood Mapping**: Factory methods for mood-based audio characteristics

### 4. MoodEngine Integration

Connects audio analysis with mood detection:

- **Context-Aware Mood Detection**: Adapts to time-of-day and user preferences
- **Mood Stability**: Provides smooth transitions between detected moods
- **Confidence Tracking**: Reports confidence levels for mood detection

## Using the Module

### Analyzing Audio Files

```swift
let service = AudioAnalysisService()

// Option 1: Using Combine
service.analyzeAudio(at: audioFileURL)
    .sink(
        receiveCompletion: { completion in
            // Handle completion
        },
        receiveValue: { features in
            // Use extracted features
            print("Energy: \(features.energy ?? 0)")
            print("Tempo: \(features.tempo ?? 0) BPM")
        }
    )
    .store(in: &cancellables)

// Option 2: Using async/await
Task {
    do {
        let bridge = AudioAnalysisBridge()
        let features = try await bridge.analyzeAudioFile(at: audioFileURL)
        // Use extracted features
    } catch {
        // Handle errors
    }
}
```

### Real-time Analysis

```swift
// Initialize service
let service = AudioAnalysisService()

// Process a buffer from audio input
if let features = service.analyzeAudioBuffer(audioBuffer) {
    // Update UI with new features
    updateVisualization(features)
    
    // Get the mood from features
    let mood = detectMood(from: features)
}
```

### Performance Monitoring

```swift
// Get performance statistics
let report = service.getPerformanceStatistics()
print(report)
```

## UI Components

The module includes several UI components to visualize audio analysis:

- **AudioAnalysisView**: Main view for displaying analysis results
- **AudioAnalysisLauncher**: Simple launcher for accessing the analysis features
- **AudioAnalysisDashboardWidget**: Widget for integrating into dashboard screens

## Implementation Notes

- The audio analysis is performed on a background queue to avoid UI blocking
- Memory usage is carefully managed with buffer pooling and autorelease pools
- Analysis can be canceled if needed during long operations
- Results are cached to avoid redundant processing of the same files

   - Created complete .xcdatamodeld schema
   - Implemented MixTape and Song entities with proper relationships
   - Added NSManagedObject subclasses with full functionality
   - Integrated audio features persistence

## ‚ùå Remaining Critical Issues
1. **Audio Analysis Implementation**
   - AudioAnalysisService needs real DSP implementation
   - Missing Core ML model integration for mood detection
   - Need proper audio buffer management

2. **SiriKit Integration**
   - Missing Intent definition file configuration
   - Incomplete INPlayMediaIntentHandling implementation
   - Voice shortcut donation flow needed

3. **UI Navigation Flow**
   - MainTabView connections incomplete
   - Navigation between AI generation and main content missing
   - Sheet presentation issues in various views

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Major Issues
1. **Asset and Resource Management**
   - Missing app icons and launch screen
   - No bundled placeholder images
   - Audio file handling for local playback incomplete

2. **Performance Concerns**
   - AI processing needs to move off main thread
   - Audio analysis cancellation handling missing
   - Memory management for audio buffers needed

3. **User Experience**
   - Onboarding flow incomplete
   - Error handling needs implementation
   - Loading states missing in AI views

## ‚úÖ Working Components
1. **Core Data & Models**
   - Complete data model schema
   - NSManagedObject subclasses with full implementation
   - Proper relationships and attributes
   - Audio feature persistence support

2. **AI Architecture**
   - Mood detection UI and logic structure
   - Personality engine framework
   - Basic audio visualization
   - Service integration architecture

3. **Code Quality**

   - Reactive programming with Combine
   - SwiftUI view composition
   - Comprehensive type definitions

## üîß Updated Action Items (Prioritized)
1. **High Priority**
   - Implement real audio processing (Est: 8h)
   - Complete SiriKit integration (Est: 4h)
   - Add error handling system (Est: 5h)

2. **Medium Priority**
   - Fix navigation flow issues (Est: 6h)

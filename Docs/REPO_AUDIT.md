# Repository Audit (Current)

Summary of the current repo state and recommendations for robustness, clarity, and security.

## Findings
- Naming: Legacy references to "AI-Mixtapes" remain in Xcode scheme/product identifiers. Acceptable for now; not user-facing in docs.
- Toolchain: Swift 6 / Xcode 26 aligned; CI uses Xcode 16 runners (Swift 6) consistently.
- CI: Caching and paths-ignore configured; primary Swift 6 CI present; legacy CI throttled.
- Security: CodeQL, secret scan (Gitleaks), dependency review, Dependabot, SECURITY policy present.
- Docs: High-signal docs exist (INDEX, CODE_CONTEXT, ARCHITECTURE, DEV_NOTES, AI_GUIDE, ADRs, MODULES, PLAYBOOKS, PROMPT_RECIPES, FAQ, CHANGE_CATALOG, ONBOARDING, RELEASE_CHECKLIST).
- Branch Protection: Workflow and script provided; requires PAT secret `ADMIN_TOKEN`.

## Recommendations
- Consider renaming Xcode scheme/product when feasible (non-blocking) to remove remaining legacy naming.
- Add a small lint job (SwiftLint/SwiftFormat) with path filters to keep PRs tidy.
- Schedule nightly cache warm-up CI to speed first builds.
- Enforce signed or DCO commits via branch protection or an action.
- Add automated DocC publishing on release tags.
- Maintain ADRs for future cross-cutting decisions.

## Next Candidates for ADRs
- Consolidated module strategy vs. separate UI modules.
- Networking abstraction around Socket.IO and offline fallbacks.
- Data model versioning and Core Data migration approach.

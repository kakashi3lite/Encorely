# Prompt Recipes (Context-Saving)

Use these minimal, high-signal prompts to guide AI tools.

## Add a Button to a Screen
- Task: Add a "Shuffle" button to MixTapeView.
- Files: `Sources/App/Consolidated/MixTapeView.swift`
- Excerpt: Provide 20â€“40 lines around the place you want to insert.
- Constraints: Respect SwiftLint rules; add accessibility label.

## Hook a New Socket Event
- Task: Handle `playlist:recommendations` event.
- Files: `Sources/MCPClient/MCPClient.swift`
- Excerpt: Show existing event handlers and target injection points.

## Add a Data Model

General tips:
